What does fast-forward in Git mean?
Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. 
In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.
Why should you have different branches?
If people are working on a project, there is a high change that the code has conflicts. To avoid them, people usually work on their own 
branches and commit the changes to main, so that they always have the previous working code in their respective 
branches if anything goes wrong. 
In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
If the codebase is large to maintain in a single repository, we can go ahead and store the codebase in different respositories 
which is efficient. There is no limit for creating the repositories.
